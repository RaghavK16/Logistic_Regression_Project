# Logistic_Regression_Project

In this 2-hour long project-based course, I learnt how to implement Logistic Regression using Python and Numpy.

Logistic Regression is an important fundamental concept if you want break into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Even though popular machine learning frameworks have implementations of logistic regression available, it's still a great idea to learn to implement it on your own to understand the mechanics of optimization algorithm, and the training and validation process.

I created and trained a logistic model that was able to predict if a given image is of hand-written digit zero or of hand-written digit one. The model was able to distinguish between images, or 0s and 1s, and it does that with a very high accuracy.
